# Paper Skeleton (GitHub-ready)

## Local build
- Install TeX Live (or MiKTeX) + `latexmk`
- Place your generated figures/snippets under `figure/` (already done by WOOP)
- Build:
```bash
make
# or
python scripts/build_pdf.py
# or
./scripts/build_pdf.sh
```

## GitHub Actions
- Commit this repo (including `figure/` PNG/TEX files)
- Push to GitHub; the workflow `.github/workflows/build-paper.yml` builds `main.pdf`
- Download artifact **paper-pdf** from the Actions run

## Files
- `main.tex` – minimal paper skeleton
- `foundations_blocks.tex` – Part I (Foundations)
- `results_blocks.tex` – placeholder includes (you already have figure snippets)
- `figure/` – generated by your analysis pipeline (not included here)
- `Makefile`, `scripts/build_pdf.ps1|.sh` – local builds
- `.github/workflows/build-paper.yml` – CI build on push/PR
